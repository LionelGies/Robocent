            We here at RoboCent treat your privacy and data with the utmost respect.
            We never sell or repackage any data provided to RoboCent to execute calls
            and texts -- more on our data policy can be found in our Terms and Conditions.
            Similarly, RoboCent only uses data collected on our users to improve our platform
            and make it more user-friendly. This privacy policy was drafted by

          <h3>Website <span class="orange">Visitors</span></h3>

          <p>
            Like most website operators, RoboCent collects non-personally-identifying
            information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available,
            such as the browser type, language preference, referring site,
            and the date and time of each visitor request.
            RoboCent's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information
            is to better understand how RoboCent's visitors use its website.
            From time to time, RoboCent may release non-personally-identifying information
            in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage
            of its website.
          </p>

          <p>
            RoboCent also collects potentially personally-identifying information
            like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users
            leaving comments on WordPress.com blogs. RoboCent only discloses logged
            in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it
            uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below,
            except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the
            administrators of the blog where the comment was left.
          </p>

          <h3>Gathering of <span class="green">Personally-Identifying</span> Information</h3>

          <p>
            Certain visitors to RoboCent's websites choose to interact with RoboCent
            in ways that require RoboCent to gather personally-identifying information.
            The amount and type of information that RoboCent gathers depends on the
            nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for
            an account at RoboCent.com to provide a username and email address.
            Those who engage in transactions with RoboCent – by purchasing system credits,
            for example – are asked to provide additional information,
            including as necessary the personal and financial information
            required to process those transactions. In each case,
            RoboCent collects such information only insofar as is necessary or
            appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with RoboCent.
            RoboCent does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as
            described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying
            information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain
            website-related activities.
          </p>

          <h3><span class="orange">Aggregated</span> Statistics</h3>

          <p>
            RoboCent may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites.
            For instance, RoboCent may monitor the most active users on the RoboCent.com
            site to help improve the service or block spam.
            roboCent may display this information publicly or provide it to others.
            However, RoboCent does not disclose personally-identifying information
            other than as described below.
          </p>

          <h3>Protection of Certain <span class="green">Personally-Identifying</span> Information</h3>

          <p>
            RoboCent discloses potentially personally-identifying and
            personally-identifying information only to those of its employees,
            contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that
            information in order to process it on RoboCent's behalf or to
            provide services available at RoboCent's websites, and (ii)
            that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees,
            contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of
            your home country; by using RoboCent's websites, you consent to the
            transfer of such information to them. RoboCent will not rent or sell
            potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information
            to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations,
            as described above, RoboCent discloses potentially personally-identifying
            and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena,
            court order or other governmental request, or when RoboCent believes in
            good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property
            or rights of RoboCent, third parties or the public at large.
            If you are a registered user of an RoboCent website and have supplied
            your email address, RoboCent may occasionally send you an email to
            tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you
            up to date with what’s going on with RoboCent and our products.
            We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type
            of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum.
            If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one
            of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order
            to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.
            RoboCent takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against
            the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially
            personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
          </p>

          <h3>Cookies</h3>

          <p>
            A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s
            computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each
            time the visitor returns. RoboCent uses cookies to help RoboCent
            identify and track visitors, their usage of RoboCent website,
            and their website access preferences. RoboCent visitors who do
            not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their
            browsers to refuse cookies before using RoboCent's websites,
            with the drawback that certain features of RoboCent's websites
            may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
          </p>

          <h3>Business <span class="orange">Transfers</span></h3>

          <p>
            If RoboCent, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired,
            or in the unlikely event that RoboCent goes out of business or enters bankruptcy,
            user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or
            acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur,
            and that any acquirer of RoboCent may continue to use your personal
            information as set forth in this policy.
          </p>

          <h3>Ads</h3>

          <p>
            Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by
            advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the
            ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online
            advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer.
            This information allows ad networks to, among other things,
            deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of
            most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies
            by RoboCent and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
          </p>

          <h3><span class="green">Privacy</span> Policy Changes</h3>

          <p>
            Although most changes are likely to be minor,
            RoboCent may change its Privacy Policy from time to time,
            and in RoboCent's sole discretion. RoboCent encourages visitors
            to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy.
            If you have a WordPress.com account, you should also check your blog’s
            dashboard for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this site
            after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance
            of such change.
